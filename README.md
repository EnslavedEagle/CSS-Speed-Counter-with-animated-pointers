### What the hell is it?

It's a fully-responsive Speed Counter with animated pointers. Build entirely with HTML, CSS (Sass) and vanilla JavaScript.


#### I'd like to edit this.

No problem. Just follow the instructions below.

- Open the console/terminal,
- Type `npm i` to install dependecies,
- Wait...
- Type `gulp watch`,
- There you go, you can now edit the Sass files which will automatically get compiled into CSS.
